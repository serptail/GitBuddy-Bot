# GitHub Bot

GitHub Bot is a powerful automation tool designed to interact with GitHub's API. It allows you to automatically star repositories and follow users based on specific criteria, ensuring compliance with GitHub's Terms of Service. With features like rate limit awareness, undo operations, and graceful shutdown, GitHub Bot is your ideal companion for managing GitHub activity efficiently and safely.

## Features

- **Automatic Starring**: Automatically star repositories based on a set criteria (e.g., created in the last day, less than 4 stars).
- **Automatic Following**: Follow users who own the repositories that meet the criteria.
- **Undo Operations**: Unstar repositories and unfollow users to revert the operations.
- **Rate Limit Awareness**: Checks and respects GitHub API rate limits to avoid being throttled.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Listens for shutdown signals to stop operations cleanly.
- **Slow-Paced Operations**: Introduces delays between operations to comply with GitHub's anti-spam policies.

## Working Principle

1. **Rate Limit Check**: Before starting operations, the bot checks the current rate limit to ensure it doesn't exceed the allowed number of requests.
2. **Fetch Repositories**: Searches for repositories created in the last day with less than 4 stars.
3. **Process Repositories**: Stars the repositories and follows the owners with a delay between each operation to avoid spam.
4. **Undo Operations**: Provides functionality to unstar repositories and unfollow users that were starred and followed during the bot's operations.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or higher**: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed on your machine.
- **Gradle**: Used for building the project. If you don't have Gradle installed, the wrapper included in the repository can be used.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bitartisan1/gitbuddy-bot.git
    cd gitbuddy-bot
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
    Ensure you have Java 11 or higher installed.

### Setting Up GitHub Token

1. **Obtain a Personal Access Token**:
    - Go to [GitHub's Personal Access Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    - Click on "Generate new token (classic)".
    - Give your token a descriptive name.
    - Set an expiration for your token as per your preference.

2. **Set Required Permissions**:
    - Under `Select scopes`, select the following permissions:
      - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
      - `public_repo` (Access public repositories)
      - `user` (Read and write user profile data)
    - Click "Generate token".

3. **Copy the Token**:
    - Copy the generated token. You won't be able to see it again once you navigate away from the page.

4. **Set Up Environment Variable**:
    - **Windows**:
      - Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
      - Click the "Environment Variables…" button.
      - In the "System variables" section, click "New…".
      - Set `Variable name` to `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `Variable value` to your copied token.
      - Click OK and apply the changes.
    - **macOS/Linux**:
      - Open a terminal window.
      - Run the following command to set the environment variable:
        ```sh
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
        ```
      - To make this change permanent, add the above line to your shell's startup file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

### Compiling in an IDE

#### Visual Studio Code

1. **Open Project**:
    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Open the cloned repository folder.

2. **Install Extensions**:
    - Install the Java Extension Pack from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

3. **Build and Run**:
    - Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+``).
    - Use the following command to build the project:
      ```sh
      ./gradlew build
      ```
    - Run the project using the command:
      ```sh
      java -jar build/libs/github-bot.jar
      ```

#### IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Open Project**:
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Select "Open" and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

2. **Import Project**:
    - IntelliJ will detect the `build.gradle` file and prompt to import the project. Click "Import Gradle Project".

3. **Build and Run**:
    - Use the build tool window to execute `./gradlew build`.
    - Run the `GitHubBot` class by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run 'GitHubBot.main()'".

### Using the JAR Release

1. **Download the JAR**:
    - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/bitartisan1/gitbuddy-bot/releases) section of the repository.
    - Download the latest `.jar` release.

2. **Run the JAR**:
    ```sh
    java -jar path/to/github-bot.jar
    ```

## Usage

### Method 1: Building and Running

1. **Build the Project**:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew build
    ```

2. **Run the Bot**:
    ```sh
    java -jar build/libs/github-bot.jar
    ```

### Method 2: Running the Compiled `.jar` File

1. **Download the Compiled `.jar` File**:
    If you already have the compiled `.jar` file, you can directly run it using the following command:
    ```sh
    java -jar github-bot.jar
    ```

## Changing the Query/Search Criteria

If you want to change the query or search criteria, you need to modify the code in the `Utils.java` file. Here is how you can do it:

1. **Open `Utils.java`**:
    - Locate the `fetchAllRepositories` method in the `Utils.java` file.

2. **Modify the Query**:
    - Find the line where the query is set:
      ```java
      String query = URLEncoder.encode(String.format("created:>%s stars:<4", yesterday), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      ```
    - Change the query string to your desired criteria. For example, if you want to search for repositories with more than 10 stars, you can modify it as follows:
      ```java
      String query = URLEncoder.encode(String.format("created:>%s stars:>10", yesterday), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      ```

3. **Build and Run**:
    - After modifying the query, rebuild the project and run it again using the instructions provided in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## Detailed Explanation

### Rate Limit Check

The bot first checks the rate limit using the GitHub API endpoint `/rate_limit`. This ensures that the bot does not exceed the allowed number of requests per hour.

### Fetch Repositories

The bot searches for repositories that were created in the last day and have less than 4 stars. This is done using the GitHub search API with a query parameter.

### Process Repositories

For each repository found, the bot:
1. **Stars the Repository**: Stars the repository using the GitHub API if it hasn't been starred before.
2. **Follows the User**: Follows the user who owns the repository if they haven't been followed before.

A delay of 5 seconds is introduced between each operation to avoid being flagged as spam.

### Undo Operations

The bot can undo its operations by un-starring repositories and unfollowing users. This is useful if you want to revert the actions performed by the bot.

### Graceful Shutdown

The bot listens for shutdown signals and stops its operations cleanly to ensure no incomplete actions are left.
